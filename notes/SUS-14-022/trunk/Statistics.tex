compares the data and the Monte Carlo expectation in different channels. The top row 
shows the \mttwo distributions in the \leptonTau channels. 
In these plots, the QCD multijet and \wjets and fake contribution from other channels are shown 
as ``Fake'' which were described in Sec.\ref{sect:bkgFake}.
The bottom row shows the \mttwo and \SumMT variables in two different signal regions of \tauTau channel . 
The QCD multijet contribution in these plots come from the data driven method described in 
Sec.\ref{sect:bkgQCD}. The \wjets in the last bin of the top plots was described in Sec.\ref{sect:bkgW}. 
In these 4 plots, all of the statistical and systematical uncertainties are considered.

There is no excess of events over the SM expectation.  We interpret our results in the context
of a simplified model of chargino pair-production and decay, which corresponds to the left
diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:Productions}. This is a simplified model when a pair of \chione 
are produced and decay exclusively to the shown final states which contain two $\tau$, two $\nu_{\tau}$ and two \PSGczDo.
The mediators in the decay of \chione can be either \sTau or $\sNu_{\tau}$. All  \sTau and $\sNu_{\tau}$ 
are produced  on-shell. They have equal masses which is the mean value of the masses of the \chione   and \PSGczDo.
The two distinct decay chains in the left diagram of Fig.~\ref{fig:Productions} are assumed to have equal branching ratios, which is 50\%.

A modified frequentist approach, namely CLs method \cite{read:CLs} is used to 
exclude the signal points at 95\% Confidence Level.
Combining all four signal regions,
the search rules out \chione  masses up to 420 \GeV  for a massless \PSGczDo and  \PSGczDo masses up to 100 \GeV for some  \chione masses,
see Fig.~\ref{fig:limit_final}.

The boundaries are well beyond the ATLAS reach which is \chione  masses up to 345 \GeV \cite{Aad:2014yka}. Adding \leptonTau channels
and considering two signal regions in \tauTau channel has increased the sensitivity of the current search compared to ATLAS which uses only 
one search region in \tauTau channel to make the exclusion.
The \sTau searches in the LEP experiments \cite{lepsusy} have excluded the masses below 95 \GeV. In Fig.~\ref{fig:limit_final}, 
this region corresponds to the triangle in bottom-left corner.% is shown by the line labeled as $m_{\sTau} < 95 \GeV$. 
The diagonal line denotes the boundary for $m_{\chione} = m_{\tau} + m_{LSP}$, which is the kinematical boundary of the search.
The expected limits and their one standard deviations introduced by the experimental 
uncertainties are shown with the red solid and dashed lines, respectively. The observed limits are shown with the black solid lines, the one 
standard deviations are shown with narrower black lines. The theoretical cross sections are moved up and down by one one standard deviation to 
find the narrow lines.
The signal cross sections in NLO + next-to-the-leading-logarithm (NLL) order in $\alpha_s$ are used to make the exclusion limits.
In the whole region, the observed limits lie closer than one standard deviation from the expected limits.  

The exclusion limits when only the \tauTau channels are used is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:limit_tauTau}.

Even in this case, still the results are comparable with ATLAS results.


The results of the \tauTau channels are interpreted to set limit on the $\tilde{\tau}\tilde{\tau}$ production, which corresponds to the right diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:Productions}. In this simplified model, two $\tilde{\tau}$ are directly produced from the $pp$ collision and decay instantly into two $\tau$ and two \PSGczDo. As the cross section of direct production of sleptons is lower,

\end{linenomath}
 no point is excluded and $95\%$ upper limit is set on the cross section. Adding two $\ell\Tau$ channels does not improve the results.
Figure ~\ref{fig:limit_stau_stau} represents the ratio of the 
obtained upper limit on the cross section and the cross section expected from SUSY (signal strength) vs. the mass of the $\tilde{\tau}$ particle, when \PSGczDo mass is $1 \GeV$.
The observed ratio is within one standard deviation of  the expected ratio.
The best limit which corresponds to the lowest signal strength is obtained for $m_{\tilde{\tau}}=110 \GeV$. The observed (expected) upper limit on the cross section at this mass is 228 (328) $fb$ which is almost 3 times of the theoretical NLO cross section.


%{\bf (You need to spend one sentence to explain what method you are using to set limits.  I assume
%  it is CLs, but because I am not sure what you actually did I did not write
%  it down.  Also, you
%  need to specify whether this is 95\% CL or 90\% CL or whatever).}
%{\bf (The description of the simplified model is insufficient.  Surely the cross-section and branching
%  ratios depends on the stau mass and/or the sneutrino mass?  It must also make a difference whether
%  the stau/sneutrino are on- or off-shell and what their masses are as far as the acceptance
%  is concerned.
%  Also in Figure 1 left there are two distinct
%  decay chains.  What BR are you assuming for the two chains)}
%{\bf The caption for the figure is incorrect..it says expected but there is also observed.  The boundaries
%  of the plot (diagonal lines) need to be explained.)}

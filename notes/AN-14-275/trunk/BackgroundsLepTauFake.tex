\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Fake Background Estimation in $\leptonTau$ Channel}{Fake Background Estimation in lepton-tau Channel}}
\label{sect:bkgLeptau}
In the $e/\mu\hadtau$ channels, the main background is the W+jets, when the \Wpm boson decays to a lepton and a jet fakes a hadronic $\tau$.
We use a fake rate method to estimate this background \cite{CMS_AN_2010-261} in the \muTau channel.
The idea is that when the loose signal selection is applied, the number of the loose $\hadtau$'s ($L$) is:
\begin{equation}
L = P + F
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the number of the  prompt $\hadtau$'s and $F$ is the number of the  fake $\hadtau$'s. If the selection is tightened, the number of the tight $\hadtau$'s (T) is
\begin{equation}
 T = pP + fF
\end{equation} 
$p$ ($f$) is the prompt (fake) rate, the probability that a loosely selected prompt (fake) $\hadtau$ can pass the  tight  selection. The loose category ($L$) can be divided to two parts, 
tight ($T$) and non-tight ($NT$), so one can write:
\begin{equation}
   F * (f - p) = ((1 - p) * L - NT)
\end{equation}
$f$ * $F$ is the contamination of the fake $\hadtau$'s in the signal region. 

The fake rate ($f$) is measured as the ratio of the tightly selected $\hadtau$'s to the loosely 
selected $\hadtau$'s in a sample which is dominated by the fake $\hadtau$'s. The fake rate is estimated in an environment which is as similar as possible to 
the signal region. The dataset and the triggers which are used to estimate the fake rate %in different channels 
are shown in table \ref{Tab.DataFR}.

%In the muTau channel, exactly one muon is required which passes the selection criteria of the muon in the signal region and has \pt > 27 GeV. 
Lepton selection and extra lepton rejections are exactly same as the signal selection. Only the \pt of the %favorite 
leading lepton is forced to 
be 3 \GeV higher than the online cut resulting to \pt $>$ 27 \GeV for muon.% and \pt $>$ 30 \GeV for electron.
The rejections can reduce the contribution of the VV, DY and $\ttbar$ events. To further suppress the $\ttbar$ contamination, the b-veto 
similar to the signal selection is applied. The \MET is asked to be greater than 30 GeV, similar to the preselections. The selection of the $\hadtau$ is exactly same as the signal selection, except the $\hadtau$ isolation which is {\it Loose} for the loosely selected $\hadtau$'s and {\it Tight} for the tightly selected $\hadtau$'s. 
The ratio of the  categories determines the fake rate. To avoid any bias from the trigger, the $\hadtau$'s closer than $\Delta$R = 0.2 to the 
lepton are rejected. The \muTau pair are also forced to be same sign to decrease the prompt \Tau's.
The fake rate can be measured in the bins of $\hadtau$ \pt and $\eta$, but it is observed that the dependency is very small and can be ignored, 
so we use a single value for the fake rate which is 0.45 $\pm$ 0.0062.

The prompt rate ($p$) is measured in the MC DY events. All of the preselections except the $mu$ selection and extra lepton rejection %the Z-veto and $\hadtau$ isolation 
are applied. 
The $\hadtau$ isolation 
is relaxed from {\it Tight} to {\it Loose}. Only the events in which a generated $\tau$ decays hadronically are considered. If a reconstructed $\hadtau$ is 
closer than $\Delta R = 0.1$ to the generated $\tau$, it is selected. Among these $\Tau$'s, the prompt rate is defined as the fraction of the loose $\hadtau$'s 
which are tight. The prompt rate can be measured in the bins of \mttwo, but the statistics in the high \mttwo region which is our favorite 
region is so low that we can not conclude anything about the shape of the prompt rate in this region, so we choose it as a constant value
0.77 $\pm$ 0.0032 in the whole \mttwo region.

shows the results when the method is used to estimate the fake contamination of the W+Jets events that pass the selection. 
The fake rate is evaluated in the same sample with similar procedure as the data. The measured fake rate  is very close to
the previous value 0.43 $\pm$  0.0065. To calculate the fake rate, the MC truth are used to select the events with a fake \Tau 
and a prompt muon. The method is applied on the same events with a loose \Tau selection and compared to the W+Jets events with at least 
a fake \Tau. The requirement of prompt muon is removed here. To have a handle against the signal contamination when later the method is applied 
on data, in the loosely selected events, the cut on \tauMT is also removed. The final estimation from the method is corrected by the efficiency 
of \tauMT $>$ 200 GeV cut which is read from MC. It can be seen that the estimation is close to the MC truth within the uncertainties.
The reported uncertainties only contain the statistical uncertainties on the used numbers and the systematic uncertainties due to arithmetic 
which are involved. Table \ref{tbl:LepTauEstimationClosure}

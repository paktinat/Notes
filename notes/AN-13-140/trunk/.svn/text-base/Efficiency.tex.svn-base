\subsection{Trigger Selection}
\label{sect:triggerselection}
{\bf FIXME The plots need to have similar styles.}
To investigate the efficiency of different trigger sets the SMST2tt sample is used. The selection cuts described in section \ref{subsect:mt2bcuts} are applied on top of the trigger selection. The ratio of the signal events passing all the cuts is shown for two different sets of triggers as a function of $\tilde{t}$ mass and $\tilde{\chi^0_1}$ mass in figure \ref{fig:trg_eff}. Although the signal efficiency is $\sim 4$ times larger when the $HT$ trigger is used, MC studies show that the number of remaining backgrounds are so larger that the multi-jet trigger is more powerful to exclude. The estimated exclusion power of both triggers are compared in figure \ref{fig:trgs_exclusion_powers}.

\section{Summary}
\label{sect:conclusion}
A search for SUSY in the $\tau\tau$ final state has been performed where the
$\tau$ pair is produced in a cascade decay from the electroweak production of a chargino pair.  The data analyzed were from pp collisions
at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8\TeV collected by the CMS detector at the LHC corresponding to integrated luminosities between $18.1$ and $19.6~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. 
To maximize the sensitivity, the selection criteria are optimized for \tauTau (small $\Delta m$), 
\tauTau (large $\Delta m$), and \leptonTau channels using the variables \mttwo, \tauMT, and \SumMT.
The observed number of events is consistent with the SM expectations. 
In the context of simplified models, assuming that the third generation
sleptons are the lightest sleptons and that their masses lie midway between
that of the chargino and the neutralino, charginos lighter than 420\GeV 
for a massless neutralino are excluded at a 95\% confidence level. 
For neutralino masses up to 100\GeV, chargino masses up to 325\GeV are excluded
at a 95\% confidence level.
Upper limits on the direct $\tilde{\tau}\tilde{\tau}$ production cross section are also provided, 
and the best limit obtained is for the massless neutralino scenario, which is two times
larger than the theoretical NLO cross sections.

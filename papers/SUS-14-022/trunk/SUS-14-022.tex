% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{Results are presented from a search for the electroweak production of supersymmetric particles in proton-proton collisions in final states with two $\tau$ leptons. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity between $18.1~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ and $19.6~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s} = 8~\mathrm{TeV}$, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The observed event yields in the signal regions are consistent with the expected standard model backgrounds. The results are interpreted using simplified models describing the pair production and decays of charginos or $\tau$ sleptons. For chargino pair production, assuming that the third-generation sleptons are the lightest sleptons and that their masses lie midway between that of the chargino and neutralino, an excluded region in the plane of the neutralino mass vs. chargino mass is obtained. Chargino masses below about $420~\mathrm{GeV}$ are excluded at a 95\% confidence level in the limit of a massless neutralino, and for neutralino masses up to 100 GeV, chargino masses up to 325 GeV are excluded at 95\% confidence level. Constraints are also placed on the cross section for pair production of $\tau$ sleptons as a function of mass, assuming a light neutralino.}
